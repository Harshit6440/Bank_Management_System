# Bank Management System using Java Swing and AWT
This project is a Bank Management System implemented using Java Swing and AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to perform various banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and fund transfers.

# Features
* Account Creation: Users can create new bank accounts by providing necessary details like name, address, contact number, and initial deposit amount.
* Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their bank accounts by entering the account number and the amount to be deposited.
* Withdrawal: Users can withdraw funds from their bank accounts by entering the account number and the amount to be withdrawn. Sufficient balance validation is performed before allowing withdrawals.
* Balance Inquiry: Users can check the current balance of their bank accounts by entering the account number.
* Fund Transfer: Users can transfer funds from one bank account to another by entering the source account number, destination account number, and the amount to be transferred. Sufficient balance validation is performed before allowing transfers.
* Account Search: Users can search for a specific bank account by entering the account number. The account details including the account holder's name, address, contact number, and balance are displayed.

# Technologies Used
* Java: The core programming language used for implementing the bank management system.
* Swing: The Java Swing library is utilized for creating the graphical user interface components like buttons, labels, text fields, and panels.
* AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): The AWT library is used for additional GUI components and event handling.
* MySQL Database: A MySQL database is employed to store and retrieve the bank account information, including account details and transaction history.
